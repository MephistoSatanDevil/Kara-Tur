For Baldur's Gate : EE, Baldur's Gate Trilogy (BGT) and the Enhanced Edition Trilogy (EET).


## Description:
---------------

The quest starts at the Friendly Arm Inn (just to the left after entering the drawbridge). There will be 3 monks, the one in red has a story to tell you. If you take his quest and then complete it; when you return he will give you a unique leveling relic (with a future quest tied to it). Once completing the quest he will also open up a Store from Kara-Tur. 

The store has a mix of about 30+ new items (around 7 or so new types). The relic is something you'll have to figure out how to work, but it has 4 levels of power. All in all it shouldn't be too over the top, the highest items in the store are +2 and there are only 3 if I remember correctly.
